# Portfolio Site #

## Hello there!
If you're reading this, first off let me say thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio page. Here you'll find repo links to some of the projects I've worked on, and links to my social media as well. I'll be updating and revamping this site over time, as I learn new skills and tinker with new technologies. There's always going to be room for improvement, no matter how many years of experience someone has! 

## Composition:
This site was composed using:
- Genreal styling is done with CSS.
- Each section of the page is built in its own React component. 
- Dark Mode is a controlled by a React hook.
