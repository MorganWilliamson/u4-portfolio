# Portfolio Site #

## Hello!
If you're reading this, thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio page. Here you'll find links (repos and deployed sites) to some of the most recent projects I've worked on, and links to my social media as well.

## Site Composition:
This site was composed using:
- React, primarily, with each chunk of the page (as outlined below) built in its own React component. 
- Dark Mode is a controlled by a hook, intended to switch active stylesheets for the page when clicked. 

## URL
- You can find a link to the deployed site here:
